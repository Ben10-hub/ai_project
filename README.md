"Hello everyone. Today, I will walk you through the AI-driven parking charges project that utilizes number plate recognition, personalized slots for EVs, and special offers for regular customers."

Code Overview:

Image Capture:
"We start by capturing an image using a webcam. The capture_image.py script handles this, saving the captured frame as captured_image.jpg in the images directory."

Main Detection Logic:
"The main script, main.py, loads this captured image and processes it to detect number plates and green plates for EVs. Hereâ€™s how it works:

We load the image and check its integrity.
The detect_license_plate function uses Haar cascades to detect number plates in the image.
The detect_green_plate function checks if any of the detected plates have the green color indicative of EVs using HSV color space segmentation."
Testing:
"Our tests in test_detect_green_plate.py ensure that our detection logic is functioning correctly. It loads the same captured image and verifies if the green plates are detected properly. This is crucial for ensuring our system's reliability."

Debugging:
"We have included additional debug statements in our code to ensure we can trace any issues, such as failure to load images or incorrect detection."

Conclusion:
"This project not only detects and logs parking entry and exit times using AI but also provides personalized slots for EVs and special offers for regular customers. Thank you for your attention."
